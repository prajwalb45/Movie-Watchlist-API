# Movie-Watchlist-API
This project involves building a website that utilizes the OMDB API to suggest movie names based on a search query. 
The primary objective is to develop a site where users can enter a search query and receive matching results. The site should also allow users to add these results to a watchlist and provide the ability to view and modify the watchlist whenever desired.
